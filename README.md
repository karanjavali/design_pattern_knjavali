In this application, the sellers sell products and buyers buy directly. There is no quantity limit on the seller, meaning the seller can sell to as many buyers as wanted. There is no price involved. Reminders are stored in Reminder.txt.

Seller can add products for sale (in UserProduct.txt). Buyers can state requirements. Sellers can respond to buyers.
